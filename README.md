# Rossman store sales prediction

## Project Overview
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
In this machine learning project, we will work on forecasting 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany. Reliable sales forecasts enable store managers to create effective staff schedules that increase productivity and motivation. By helping Rossmann create a robust prediction model, we will help store managers stay focused on whatâ€™s most important to them: their customers and their teams!

## Project Aim
1. Perform Feature Importance Analysis to gain feature insights and perform feature selection.
2. Forecast 6 weeks of daily sales using a suitable ML regression model. 


## Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis is the process of analysing the dataset to understand its characteristics. In this step, we will figure out the following.
- Identifying the number of unique users
- Platforms used by the users the most
- Correlations
- Checking for null / inconsistent values and various other insights are drawn.
2. **Imputation**: This step involves the process of filling the missing values in appropriate ways so that the data is not lost.
3. **Outliers Detection and removal**: Outliers are nothing but points that are abnormally distant from the other points. These kinds of outliers present in the data are detected and eliminated.
4. **Further Exploratory Data Analysis**: Further EDA is performed to understand the data more and find out a few exceptional cases.
5. **Label Encoding and One hot encoding**: Machine learning algorithms for regression can understand the input only in the form of numbers and hence it is highly essential to convert the non - numeric data that we have to numeric data by providing them labels.
6. **Model Building and evaluation** Various regression algorithms are applied on the dataset and the model that suits best for the dataset is selected. The models that we apply for this dataset are
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
7. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Once we have the right model selected (which in our case is Random forest regressor) it is also essential to understand what are the features that contribute the most or least towards the result. 

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Major programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and sharing of results.
